<p>The board game «Drugs vs Bugs» is created by PhD student at the University of Oxford — <a class="service-link" target="_blank" href="https://bugsinbangkok.wordpress.com/bugs-vs-drugs/">Célia Souque</a> — and translated into Russian by IACMAC. The ultimate goal of this project is to raise awareness of antibiotic resistance, and to succeed, we will need to involve as many people as possible. One of our aims is to put a version of the game online for people to download and print themselves. You can <a class="service-link" target="_blank" href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/files/amrgame.zip">download</a> and print game by yourself.</p>
