AMRmap (AntiMicrobial Resistance Map) is a web platform for analysis of AMR data in Russia that contains a set of tools to visualize the data on distribution of antimicrobial susceptibilities and main genetic resistance determinants in clinical microbial isolates. The AMRmap database accumulates the data from prospective multicenter AMR surveillance studies conducted by the Institute of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (IAC) and the Interregional Association for Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (IACMAC).
